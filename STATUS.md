# Status

The authors aim for the **Functional**, **Reusable** and **Available** badge
for the following reasons.

## Functional

Everything provided in this artifact is sufficient to execute and replicate
the results overviewed in this paper. 

The runnable QAlloy JAR disposed (or built through the [source](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy))
allows for experimentation of the added capabilities to Alloy, detailed
in the paper.

In particular, the *.als* models associated with each example
are also made accessible so that the user can execute them and
interact with them through the QAlloy Analyzer's capabilities.

Furthermore, the full benchmark results are provided, alongside
the specification files used.

## Reusable

The QAlloy extension is also easily repurposed, as its [source code](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy)
is thoroughly documented, providing diagrams maintained, for instance, in [extension.pdf](https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-Artifact/blob/main/doc/extension.pdf)
(also included in this artifact at *doc/extension.pdf*, for the current state of the tool) throughout
development, providing an overview of each component that make QAlloy,
pinpointing exactly *where* and *how* the extension acts.

## Available

The source code of QAlloy is publicly available and maintained at 
https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy .

The running example mentioned throughout the paper as well as the other examples are also 
publicly available at https://github.com/pf7/QAlloy-Artifact and provided 
within this package.
